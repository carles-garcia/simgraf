# simgraf (CURRENTLY IN ALPHA)*
A simple graph library written in Java.
Easily extensible.

\* Graphs and algorithms are finished but haven't been tested thoroughly

## Structure
This library contains 2 principal packages:
* graphs: Contains two graph classes and two edge classes
    * DirectedGraph
    * UndirectedGraph
    * Edge
    * WeightedEdge

* algorithms: contains four algorithms for the graphs
    * BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    * DFS (Depth-First Search)
    * Bellman-Ford
    * Dijkstra
